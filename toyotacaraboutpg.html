            Kiichiro Toyoda.Kiichiro Toyoda had traveled to Europe and the United States in 1929
            to investigate automobile production and had begun researching gasoline-powered engines
            in 1930. Toyoda Automatic Loom Works was encouraged to develop automobile production by

            China.Kiichiro Toyoda seized this opportunity to establish the Automotive Production
            Division on September 1, 1933, and began preparing to build prototype vehicles.
